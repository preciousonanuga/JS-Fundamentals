# 🧠 My JavaScript Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! 👋

This repo is where I keep all the small projects, challenges, and experiments I work on as I learn JavaScript. It's not meant to be perfect—just a place to practice, make mistakes, and improve over time.

## 📂 What’s Inside

This repo includes:

- ✨ Simple scripts (basic syntax, loops, functions, arrays, etc.)
- 🧪 Practice exercises (from tutorials or courses)
- 🎮 Mini projects (like a calculator, to-do app, etc.)
- 🛠️ My experiments with DOM, events, APIs, and more

Each folder usually contains:

- A `.js` file with my code
- An optional `index.html` to run it in the browser
- Maybe a `README.md` for that project with notes
